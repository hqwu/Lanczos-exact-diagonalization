Source code of exact diagonalization (ED), version 1.0
Copyright (C) 2019-09 Hanqing Wu

Features

(1)written in Fortran;
(2)contains both Full ED and Lanczos ED;
(3)aiming at solving interacting spin models on finite-size lattices;
(4)total Sz conserved symmetry is used to do the block diagonalization;
(5)it is portable without linking some external libraries;
(6)It is serial code and is easier for the beginner.

Installation and compilation

You need to install a Fortran complier first! I suggest you to install 
intel fortran complier, because gfortran may not recognize the sentence 
like "write(ErrMsg, "('****')")". Make sure you have read some instructions 
in the source code before you running the code.

Linux
(1)create a directory and then copy the code into directory;
(2)include other ".f90" files at the head of "Main.f90" file (please read 
the sentences marked by "!!!" carefully in the "Main.f90" file).
(3)command "ifort -O3 Main.f90 -o ED" or "gfortran Main.f90 -o ED" to complie;
(4)command "./ED" to run the code.

Windows
(1)create an empty project with visual studio;
(2)add the source code to this project;
(3)"Build" the project and then run the code.
